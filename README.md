## Overview

This is the source repository for the website supporting the KFinder mobile
application. The live site can be viewed at [https://kfinderapp.com](https://kfinderapp.com).

## Development

Since this repository is published directly to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) via
their integration, there is only one long-running branch. Minor changes are
generally applied directly to `master`. Larger, more complex changes are
undertaken in a feature-branch before being merged with a push request.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/robertwtucker/kfinderapp-site/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
